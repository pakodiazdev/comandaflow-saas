# 📑 Instructions: How to Fill Task Template

Use the following structure to describe and track each task.  
Replace placeholders with actual task details.  

---

## 1. Title  
- Format: **Short, action-oriented, with emoji**.  
  Example:  
  - `# 🐳 Initialize basic monorepo structure`  
  - `# 🔒 Add authentication middleware`  

---

## 2. Story  
- Write in **user story format**:  
  ```
  As a [role], I need [action/goal], so that [benefit].
  ```  
- Keep it short and clear.  
  Example:  
  > As a developer, I need to set up a monorepo so that future modules can be versioned and maintained consistently.  

---

## 3. Technical Tasks  
- List **technical steps** as checklist items.  
- Use `[ ]` for pending, `[x]` for done.  
- Prefix with relevant emoji if useful:  
  - 📂 for folder/file actions  
  - 🔧 for implementation  
  - 🧪 for testing  
  - 📝 for documentation  
- Example:  
  ```
  - [ ] 📂 Create repository
  - [ ] 🗂️ Initialize folder structure
  - [ ] 🔧 Configure CI/CD pipeline
  ```

---

## 4. Time Tracking  
### Estimates  
- Define three values in hours:  
  - **Optimistic:** minimum time if everything goes well.  
  - **Pessimistic:** maximum time if issues appear.  
  - **Tracked:** actual time spent.  

### Sessions  
- Log working sessions in JSON format:  
  ```json
  [
    { "date": "YYYY-MM-DD", "start": "HH:MM", "end": "HH:MM" }
  ]
  ```  
- Add multiple objects for multiple sessions.

## ✅ Example (for reference)

## ✅ Technical Tasks
